- Check for updates: `site-vault --update`

### Backup Process

1. When you run `site-vault`, it will list all available projects from your Apache configurations.
2. Select a project from the list (you can type to filter the list).
3. SiteVault will display project details and ask for confirmation before proceeding.
4. If confirmed, SiteVault will create a backup of the selected project.
5. You'll be asked if you want to transfer the backup to another server.
6. If you choose to transfer, you'll be prompted for the destination server details.
7. After the transfer (if selected), you'll have the option to delete the local backup.

## Requirements

- Bash shell
- Apache2 web server
- SSH client (for remote transfers)
